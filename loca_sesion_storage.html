<!-- 
The sessionStorage Object
The sessionStorage object is identical to the localStorage object.

The difference is that the sessionStorage object stores data for one session.

The data is deleted when the browser is closed. -->


<!-- 
The localStorage object provides access to a local storage for a particular Web Site. It allows you to store, read, add, modify, and delete data items for that domain.

The data is stored with no expiration date, and will not be deleted when the browser is closed.

The data will be available for days, weeks, and years. -->
